Use AS-IS... demo scripts for PBS Professional Checkpoint Restart

 - mom_priv/config
   - introduces a few arguments ($restart_transmogrify, $restart_background, $action checkpoint, $action checkpoint_abort, and $action restart), which you should refer to the docs for details
 - checkpoint_abort.sh
   - script for when job is check pointed via qhold or scheduler preemption
   - there is a "debug" file dropped in /tmp, might be useful to "watch" this
 - checkpoint.sh
   - script for when job is periodically checkpointed (qsub -c [c=X or w=X]) 
   - there is a "debug" file dropped in /tmp, might be useful to "watch" this
 - restart.sh
   - script for when job is restarted via qrls
   - there is a "debug" file dropped in /tmp, might be useful to "watch" this
 - checkpointable_app.sh
   - User script to be submitted via qsub

Steps to demo:
As root
  1. Update the i$PBS_HOME/mom_priv/config with the contents of mom_priv/config.example minding the PATHs to the scripts
  2. Copy the checkpoint_abort.sh, checkpoint.sh, and restart.sh into mom_priv
  3. Chmod 755 the new scripts
  4. Restart PBS MOM

As user
  1. qsub checkpointable_app.sh
  2. tail -f ${PBS_JOBDIR}/${PBS_JOBID}.OU
     - PBS_JOBDIR can be determined by qstat -f | grep jobdir

In another terminal window, as root or the user.
  1. qhold $PBS_JOBID
     - watch the output of the tail in the user's window
  2. qrls $PBS_JOBID
     - again watch the output of the tail
  3. Allow the job to run, and you will see the period checkpoint kick in, too.
